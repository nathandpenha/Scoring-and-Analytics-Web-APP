# retrieve the file path of a data file installed with cricketr
pathToFile <- system.file("data", "tendulkarsp.csv", package = "cricketr")
batsmanPerfHomeAway(pathToFile,"Sachin Tendulkar")

# Note: The above example uses the file tendulkar.csv from the /data directory. However
# you can use any directory as long as the data file exists in that directory.
# The general format is pkg-function(pathToFile,par1,...)
